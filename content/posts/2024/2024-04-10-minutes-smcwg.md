Stephen Davidson  noted that Ballot SMC06 was in Voting Period until April 11. See https://lists.cabforum.org/pipermail/smcwg-public/2024-April/000957.html.
The WG reviewed Issue 240 raised by Martijn Karterbarg that the GOV registration scheme did not allow the use of the XX country code for countries that do not yet have an ISO-assigned code.  See https://github.com/cabforum/smime/issues/240 
Stephen confirmed that there are CAs with significant existing populations of valid Legacy generation certificates, particularly in the Sponsor- and Org-validated categories.
The WG commenced a discussion of the differences between the Legacy generation certificate profiles versus the Multipurpose and Strict.  The following summarises the conversation, providing links to the related sections.
