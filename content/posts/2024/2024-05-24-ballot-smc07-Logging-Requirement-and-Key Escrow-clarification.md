## Ballot SMC07:Align Logging Requirement and Key Escrow clarification

### Summary:

This ballot additionally aims to clarify that maximum certificate validity periods do not affect maximum key escrow duration periods.

This ballot is proposed by Martijn Katerbarg (Sectigo) and endorsed by Stephen Davidsson (DigiCert) and Tom Zermeno (SSL.com).
