## Current status of ballots

a) Ballot SC70: Clarify the use of DTPs for Domain Control Validation
- During the review period one member has files an exclusion notice according to Article 2.4, and the results of the initial vote are rescinded and deemed null and void. 
- Ben Wilson started the process of forming a patent advisory group and he is collecting names and email addresses of those interested in participating.  
- The membership criteria for the Patent Advisory Group (PAG) is unclear, specifically in relation to sections 7.1 and 7.2 of the IPR policy. Aaron said PAG in section 7.2 of IPR Policy doesn’t have an entry for the exclusion notice, and we should revise the IPR Policy. 
- There was discussion about clarifying the use of domain validation and the need for GoDaddy's involvement in understanding the exact patent claims.
- Theres was a discussion about time limits for filing exclusion notices and how it interacts with membership periods. Nicol raises a question about the clarification of substantive requirements and its interaction with the time window for filing exclusion notices. Ben acknowledges the point and suggests further examination of the situation. Aaron highlighted a concern about unclear interactions between exclusion notices and existing guidelines.

b) SC72 voting period ends on April 1st, 24.
- There was a discussion about whether votes on the discussion period should be considered valid, with some members suggesting that as long as the vote is clear and during the voting period, it should be accepted.

c) SC67 discussion period ends April 17th, 24. 
- No comments

d) Review Period - Compromised/weak keys
